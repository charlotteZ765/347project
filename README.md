# Predicting Transported Passenger Survival on the Spaceship Titanic using Supervised Classification Models

## Abstract
### This project explores the application of supervised classification models to predict passenger outcomes aboard the Spaceship Titanic, a binary classification task from the Kaggle competition. The objective is to determine whether a passenger was “transported” based on demographic, financial, and behavioral features. We implement and compare three models—Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost—to evaluate their predictive performance and interpretability. Preprocessing steps include handling missing data, feature encoding, and normalization. Model performance is assessed using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results highlight the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability, with XGBoost achieving the highest overall accuracy, while Logistic Regression offers greater transparency in feature influence. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble methods for complex classification tasks and emphasize the importance of model selection in data-driven decision-making.

## Documentation

What is the problem? For example, what are you trying to solve? Describe the motivation.
Why is this problem interesting? Is this problem helping us solve a bigger task in some way? Where would we find use cases for this problem?
What is the approach you propose to tackle the problem? What approaches make sense for this problem? Would they work well or not? Feel free to speculate here based on what we taught in class.
Why is the approach a good approach compared with other competing methods? For example, did you find any reference for solving this problem previously? If there are, how does your approach differ from theirs?
